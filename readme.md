# Integer Snake

Simplified clone of [integersnake.com](https://integersnake.com/) game.

## Why?

I got hooked on the idea and quickly made simplified clone of the integersnake.com to make phonegap version for myself to play when there is no internet access.

## Installation

No need for installation, but if you want to make Phonegap/Cordova version, this is fully compatible with no additional plugins.

## Usage

* Connect neighbouring squares that contain the same number.
* You MAY connect more than 2 numbers at once.
* The sum of the connected numbers will be put in the last square you touch.
* The other squares you touch will be randomly filled with 1, 2 or 3.
* Try to get a high score and squares with large numbers.
* Double click/tap on score to reset game.
